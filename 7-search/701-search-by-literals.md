# Search by literals

- To search by literals, simply type in a filename into the search bar (works similar to File Explorer).
- Wildcards (* and ?) are supported.
- The search will be performed **in the current context** (i.e., the current folder and/or tags)

{: .note-title }
> Example search:
>
> *.pdf
