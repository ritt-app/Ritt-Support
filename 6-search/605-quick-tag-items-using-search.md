## Quick tag items using Search
v0.7
{: .label .label-blue}

The usual way to tag items is to select an item, then clicking the checkbox next to a tag on the tag pane (see the section [Tagging files, folders, or tasks](/tags/tagging-files-folders-or-tasks)).

Suppose you are working with nested tags and they are not all in full display on the left pane, you can use Search to help you tag items more quickly.

- Select the item(s) that you wish to tag.
- Search for the tag by starting to key in the name of the tag in the Search bar.
- Tag the item(s) directly in the Search dropdown by clicking the checkbox next to the tag!<br/><br/>
