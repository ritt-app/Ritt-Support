# Activating tags

## Activating a tag

- In the tag tree (left panel), navigate to and click on a desired tag to activate it.
- Tagged items will be displayed in the right panel.
- You will see the active tag in the Address bar, along with other [*related tags*](/tags/related-tags) next to it (greyed out when not selected). Related tags are tags which have common items with currently activated tag(s).
- The grouping for the display of the tagged items is [customizable](/general/grouping-items).
