# Tagging files, folders, or tasks

Ritt offers many different ways to tag your items (files, folders, or tasks)! We have designed multiple different tagging methods to make the tagging process as frictionless as possible.

## Tagging items using the Tag Pane

- Navigate to and select the file(s), folder(s) or task(s) that you wish to tag.
- Tag the item by clicking on the empty circle next to the tag. This creates a *direct* tag. <br/><br/>

## Tagging items from the Details Pane

The Details Pane offers an alternative, possibly faster way to tag your items.

- Click on an item (or multiple items).
- Show the Details pane by clicking on the **Show/Hide Details pane**<img src="../img/v1.2-PNG-Toggle-Details-Pane.png" alt="Details Pane" width="30" style="padding: 0px 3px 0px 3px"/>button on the top banner.
- In the Details pane, you will see a section called **Tags**.
- Add new tags by typing directly into the "Add a new tag" box. This searches all existing tags. Hit `Tab` to select the first tag on the list, or use arrow keys to select the tag you are looking for. 
- You can also use this section to add a new tag that does not currently exist. The new tag will be added to the bottom of the tag tree.
- Watch the video below for a demo.<br/><br/>

Here are some other ways you can tag an item using a simple drag-and-drop:
- Drag and drop an item (from the main pane) onto a tag in the tag pane.
