# Tagging files, folders, or tasks

- Navigate to and select the file(s), folder(s) or task(s) that you wish to tag.
- Tag the item by clicking on the empty circle next to the tag. This creates a *direct* tag. <br/><br/>![Tag File](../img/Tag-File.png)<br/><br/>

When you tag a folder, all items within that folder become *indirectly* tagged to that tag. In the example below, the folder "Market research" is directly tagged to <mark style="background-color: #FFF0EE">Planning</mark>, but because it is also a subfolder of "Project A" (which is tagged to <mark style="background-color: #FFF0EE">Projects &#x25B6; A</mark>), it will also be indirectly tagged to <mark style="background-color: #FFF0EE">Projects &#x25B6; A</mark>. <br/><br/>![Direct and indirect tags](../img/Direct-vs-indirect-tags.png)
