# Related tags
v1.2
{: .label .label-purple}

Related tags are tags which have common items with currently activated tag(s). This feature helps you to quickly locate the files you are looking for by "narrowing your search".

After [activating one or more tags](/tags/activating-tags), you will see the active tag(s) in the Address bar, along with other related (inactive) tags next to them. 

- Select a related tag, and that tag will also be activated alongside any others that have already been activated. In the main pane, you will see items which are tagged to all the activated tags.<br/><br/>
