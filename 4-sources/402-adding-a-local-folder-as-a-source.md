# Adding a local folder as a Source

To add a Local folder as a Source,

  <video autoplay loop width="800" controls>
    <source src="/img/MOV-Add-New-Source.mov" type="video/mp4">

**Note:** You cannot add a subfolder of a Source as a separate Source. However, if you wish, you could [promote it to a Source](/sources/promoting-to-source).
