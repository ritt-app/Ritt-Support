# Adding a local folder as a Source
v0.9
{: .label .label-blue}

To add a Local folder as a Source,

- Click on the **Add Source** button.
- Select **Local folder** in the menu. 
- Select a folder which you wish to organize better with Ritt.<br/><br/>
  <video autoplay loop controls>
    <source src="/img/v0.9-MP4-Add-Source.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video><br/>

- You can also add a Source by simply dragging and dropping a folder from File Explorer.<br/><br/>
  <video autoplay loop controls>
    <source src="/img/v0.9-MP4-Add-Source-Drag-and-Drop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>

**Note:** You cannot add a subfolder of a Source as a separate Source. However, if you wish, you could [promote it to a Source](/sources/promoting-to-source).
