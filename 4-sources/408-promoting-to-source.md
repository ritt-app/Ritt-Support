# Promoting to Source
v0.7
{: .label .label-blue}

- This is the inverse of [Adding a parent folder as a Source](/sources/adding-a-parent-folder-as-a-source). You can promote one or more subfolders under a Source folder to become Sources themselves.
- To do this, right click on the subfolder(s), and select **Promote to Source**.
- The original Source will be replaced in the Ritt database.<br/><br/>
