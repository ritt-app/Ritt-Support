{: .label .label-blue}

- Follow the steps under [Adding a local folder as a Source](/sources/adding-a-local-folder-as-a-source) to add a parent folder as a Source.
- The parent folder will now appear as the main Source, replacing all the previous Sources which were subfolders of the parent folder.
- All existing tags associated with the items in the subfolders will not be affected.
