# Tags
Tags üè∑Ô∏è are located on the left column which identifies and classifies different files and folders. Tags can be added using the add tag button by selecting an existing tag and clicking the button which will create another tag at the same level. Clicking the add tag button without any tag selected will create a main tag. Alternatively, dragging the add tag button to existing tag will create a child tag.

## Tagging files

Files and folders can be tagged by selecting them and clicking on the tag option and every file can be tagged using many different tags. Selecting tagged files will show a tag icon on the very right side and the tag(s) that they are tagged to indicated by the blue pin icon. A file can be tagged to as many icons as you would like, but only the first three icons will be visible. Multiple files can be selected at once by holding CTRL or the middle mouse button and be tagged to many tags at once.

If the file is not directly tagged, but one or more of it's parent files are tagged, it will display a smaller pin icon on the left of the regular blue pin icon.

Dragging a file into an existing tag will create a child tag with the same name and cause the file to be automatically tagged.

## Tag trees

A hierarchical division of tags which are color coded. Selecting a parent tag will show all the children tag contained within itself, as well as any files that are tagged.

## Search tags

Using the search function will perform a greedy search to show all relevant tags.

## Changing icons

Right click on a tag to enable the option to change icons, which are chosen from the windows emoji page.


## Tag union
Similar to selecting multiple files using CTRL or middle mouse button, multiple tags can be selected at once using CTRL as well. Using the union/intersection button, select the union option to view files tagged to one or more tags. Select the intersection option to view files tagged to all tags.

## Relevant tags
A tagged file having child or parent files tagged to another tag will cause both tags to be relevant to each other. Selecting any tags will show any relevant tags being bolded or the show relevant option can be used with a right click. Selecting the relevant tags button will only show the relevant tags.

## Editing tag trees

Click and drag a tag at any layer to insert the tag (with all of its children) between any two tags at any layer. You may also move tags into other tags, which causes them to become child tags. Note that you may not move tags to become base tags, but you can insert them above the current base tag to form new base tags.

## Duplicating files

Creates an exact duplicate file which contains the same base tagged file and tagged child files.
