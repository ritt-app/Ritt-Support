# Sources

## Sources

A Source is a folder that contains items which you wish to organize using Ritt. There are two kinds of Sources.

1. **Local folder** - Any folder that is accessible with File Explorer
1. **Task collection** - A virtual folder that contains tasks

You can add multiple sources into a single Ritt database.

## Adding a local folder as a Source

To add a Local folder as a Source,

- Click on the **Add Source** button.
- Select **Local folder** in the menu. 
- Select a folder which you wish to organize better with Ritt.

  <source src="/img/MOV-Add-New-Source.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

**Note:** You cannot add a subfolder of a Source as a separate Source. However, if you wish, you could [promote it to a Source](#promoting-to-source).


## Adding a task collection

To add a task collection,

- Click on the **Add Source** button.
- Select **Task collection** in the menu.
- Give a name to the task collection.

<video autoplay loop width="500" controls>
  <source src="/img/MOV-Add-Task-Collection.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>


## Viewing all Sources

- Click on the **Home** button <img src="../img/Button-Home.PNG" alt="Home Button" width="40" style="padding: 0px 3px 0px 3px"/> to view all source folders and task collections.


## Changing the path of a Source

If a Source folder is moved to another location in your computer, Ritt may not be able to locate it. In this case, you will see a circle with an exclamation mark next to the Source, indicating that the Source path needs to be updated. 
- Click on the circle to update the Source path.<br/><br/>![Please Update Source path](/img/Please-Update-Source-path.png) <br/><br/>


In some cases, you may wish to intentionally change the path of a Source (for example, if you have two copies of the same Source folder in different locations and need to switch between them periodically). In this case, follow the steps below.

- Right click on a Source and select **Change Source path**. Select the new location of the Source.
- All tags relative to the original Source will not be affected (i.e., they will be migrated over to the "new" Source).


## Removing Source(s)

- Right click on a Source and select **Remove Source**.
- Removing a Source will remove it from the current Ritt database. The actual folder and the subfolders and files within will not be affected.


## Adding a parent folder as a Source

- Follow the steps under [Adding a local folder as a Source](#adding-a-local-folder-as-a-source) to add a parent folder as a Source.
- The parent folder will now appear as the main Source, replacing all the previous Sources which were subfolders of the parent folder.
- All existing tags associated with the items in the subfolders will not be affected.
