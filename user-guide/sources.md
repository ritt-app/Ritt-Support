# Sources

## Sources
A Source is a folder that contains files which you wish to organize using Ritt. To add a folder as a source, click on the Add Source button located next to the add tag button. You may add several folders to become the your source(s) but you cannot add a source's content as another source.

## Returning to source

Click the home button to return to the source.

## Removing source

Right click on a source to find the remove source option.

## Changing source path

Right click on a source to enable the option to change its source path. Do note that any files already tagged in the original source will be inside the new source with the missing source icon and will have to be relocated.

## Promote to source

Right click on a file to enable the option to promote it to source, thus replacing the old source. This however, will remove existing files that have already been tagged.

## Copy path
Right click on a file to show the option to copy it's absolute path.

## Duplicating files

Creates an exact duplicate file which contains the same base tagged file and tagged child files.
