# Sources

## Sources

A Source is a folder that contains items which you wish to organize using Ritt. There are two kinds of Sources.

1. **Local folder** - Any folder that is accessible with File Explorer
1. **Task collection** - A virtual folder that contains tasks

You can add multiple sources into a single Ritt database.

## Adding a local folder as a Source

To add a Local folder as a Source,

- Click on the **Add Source** button.
- Select **Local folder** in the menu.
- Select a folder which you wish to organize better with Ritt.

  <video autoplay loop width="500" controls>
    <source src="/img/MOV-Add-New-Source.mov" type="video/mp4">
  </video>



**Note:** You cannot add a subfolder of a Source as a separate Source. However, you may wish to [promote it to a Source](#promote-to-source).
