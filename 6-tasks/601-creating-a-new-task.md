# Creating a new task

In Ritt, a task is treated like a file, and needs to belong to a folder (either a real parent folder or a task collection).

Click [here](/sources/adding-a-task-collection) for instructions on how to add a new task collection. A default task collection will be automatically created if none currently exists and you try to create a task that does not belong to any folder.

- Right click in the background of the main pane and select **New task**.<br/><br/>
