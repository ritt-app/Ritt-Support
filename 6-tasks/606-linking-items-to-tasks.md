# Linking items such as files and folders to tasks
v1.2
{: .label .label-purple}

Wouldn't it be nice if you could click on a task, and immediately access the file(s) that you need to work on to complete that task?

Ritt allows you to do just that!

To link an item to a task (i.e., a file, folder or task - yes, you can link tasks together!), follow the steps below.

- Click on a task.
- Show the Details pane by clicking on the **Show/Hide Details pane**<img src="../img/v1.2-PNG-Toggle-Details-Pane.png" alt="Details Pane" width="30" style="padding: 0px 3px 0px 3px"/>button on the top banner.
- In the Details pane, you will see section called **Linked items**. You can drag and drop an item here to link it to the task!
- If the item that you want to link is not in the current view, you can **pin** the Details pin by toggle the pin icon<img src="../img/v1.2-PNG-Pin-Details-Pane.png" alt="Pin Details Pane" width="30" style="padding: 0px 3px 0px 3px"/> at the top of the Details pane (just under the item name).<br/><br/><img src="../img/v1.2-PNG-Linked-Items.png" alt="Linked Items Box" width="300"/>
