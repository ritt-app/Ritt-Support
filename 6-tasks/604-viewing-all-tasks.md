# Viewing all tasks

Suppose you have added tasks under various different folders and tags, and you would like to see all your tasks in a single list, or perhaps, all your *outstanding* tasks in a single list, there is a simple way to do that in Ritt.

- Click on the **Home** button. (This ensures that you are searching under all sources and tags.)
- Type **task** in the Search bar, press `Enter`, and voila! All your existing tasks appear in one list. As usual, you can choose to group them by location or by tag.

This makes use of the search filter **task**. Click [here](/search/search-filters) to read more about search filters.

- If you only want to see your oustanding tasks, type **task incomplete** into the Search bar.
- If you only want to see your completed tasks, type **task complete** into the Search bar.
