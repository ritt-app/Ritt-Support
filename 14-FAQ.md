## What happens after my Ritt Pro trial expires
Pro features such as Ritt Cloud Sync and Auto Tag are disabled. You cannot add new tags if you have more than 50 tags. All other features and functionalities are unchanged. Specifically, you can still tag new files and edit existing tags.

## Can I sync my tags across devices
Yes, you can, but this is a Pro feature. See [here](/rittcloud/syncing-tags-and-tasks) for more details.

## What are source folders and why are they needed?
Source folders are top-level folders that contain all the files that you wish to tag with Ritt. They allow Ritt to sync your tags across devices. To do so, connect Ritt to the same set of source folders on other devices. The paths of the source folders can differ between devices.

## Is a Mac or Linux version available?
We are planning to make Ritt cross-platform using [Uno](https://platform.uno/) but we don't have a concrete timeline for when that will happen.

## How do I report bugs, suggest new features, or provide feedback?
The fastest way is to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/GhAyuWTpVU) server, where you can expect a reply within minutes to a few hours.

## What is the model used for Auto Tag
OpenAI's CLIP is used for Auto Tag. Learn more about Auto Tag [here](https://blog.ritt.app/auto-tag-image-files-with-ai/).
