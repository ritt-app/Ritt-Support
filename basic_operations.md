# Basic Operations

## Sources
A Source is a folder that contains files which you wish to organize using Ritt. To add a folder as a source, click on the Add Source button located next to the add tag button. You may add several folders to become the your source(s) but you cannot add a source's content as another source.

### Returning to source

Click the home button to return to the source.

### Removing source

Right click on a source to find the remove source option.

## Tags
Tags üè∑Ô∏è are located on the left column which identifies and classifies different files and folders. Tags can be added using the add tag button by selecting an existing tag and clicking the button which will create another tag at the same level. Clicking the add tag button without any tag selected will create a main tag. Alternatively, dragging the add tag button to existing tag will create a child tag.

### Tagging files

Files and folders can be tagged by selecting them and clicking on the tag option and every file can be tagged using many different tags. Selecting tagged files will show a tag icon on the very right side and the tag(s) that they are tagged to indicated by the blue pin icon. A file can be tagged to as many icons as you would like, but only the first three icons will be visible. Multiple files can be selected at once by holding CTRL or the middle mouse button and be tagged to many tags at once.

If the file is not directly tagged, but one or more of it's parent files are tagged, it will display a smaller pin icon on the left of the regular blue pin icon.
