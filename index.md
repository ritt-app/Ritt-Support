# Welcome to Ritt!

**Ritt** is a productivity and file management app  that provides a revolutionary way to efficiently organize your files and folders into a lightweight database, using hierarchical tags. It complements your existing file system and gives you powerful new ways to classify and retrieve your files.

Ritt is built on top of the existing file system and provides many useful functionalities.

The central object in Ritt is the tag üè∑Ô∏è. Unlike most other tagging systems, a tag in Ritt can contain other tags as children, so tags can be ordered **hierarchically as tag trees**. In other words, you can create nested tags! A tag can be associated with many files and folders, and a file/folder can have many tags.
