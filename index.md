# Welcome to Ritt!

**Ritt** is a tag-based file management app that provides a revolutionary way to efficiently organize your files and folders into a lightweight database. Using hierachical (nested) tags, it complements your existing file system and gives you powerful new ways to classify and retrieve your files. 

The central object in Ritt is the tag üè∑Ô∏è. Unlike most other tagging systems, a tag in Ritt can contain other tags as children, so tags can be ordered **hierarchically as tag trees**. In other words, you can create nested tags! A tag can be associated with many files and folders, and a file/folder can have many tags.

In addition, your folders can also act as tags, making it possible to create links (and backlinks!) between different folders.

Ritt is built on top of your existing file system, meaning that you need not revamp your current organizational structure or spend hours setting up Ritt before you can start to reap its benefits.
