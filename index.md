# Welcome to Ritt

**Ritt** is a productivity app for Windows 10 that provides a revolutionary way to efficiently organize your files and folders into a lightweight database, using hierarchical tags. It complements your existing file system and gives you powerful new ways to classify and retrieve your files.

Ritt is built on top of the existing file system and provides many useful functionalities.

The central object in Ritt is the tag üè∑Ô∏è. Unlike most other tagging systems, a tag in Ritt can contain other tags as children, so tags can be ordered hierarchically as tag trees. A tag can also be associated with many files and folders, and a file/folder can have many tags.
