## Navigation

- Navigation in Ritt is similar to that in File Explorer.
- Double click on a folder to navigate inside, double click on a file to open it.
- Click on any folder in the Address bar for quick navigation. The scroll wheel on your mouse can be used to scroll horizontally.<br/><br/>![Navigation](/img/v1.0-PNG-Navigation.png)<br/><br/>
- You can in fact drag and drop a folder to the left pane (the tag pane). This will make navigation easier, and also allow you to make use of additional features to customize your database. More on that later.

## Activating a tag

- In the tag tree (left panel), navigate to and click on a desired tag to activate it.
- Tagged items will be displayed in the right panel.
- You will see the active tag in the Address bar, along with other [*related tags*](/tags/related-tags) next to it (greyed out when not selected). Related tags are tags which have common items with currently activated tag(s).
- The grouping for the display of the tagged items is [customizable](/general/grouping-items).

## Integrating folders and tags
